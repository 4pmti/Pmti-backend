BBB,Travis P,04/25/2021,N/A,,The PMTI Boot Camp course was such a critical aid in keeping me focused and preparing me the the PMP exam. The instructor was amazing and made it easy for me to follow along in the curriculum which aligned seamlessly with the PMBOK Guide (crucial study material). I passed the exam on my first try and went in feeling confident and ready!	 
BBB,Kathleen E,4/21/2021,N/A,,I had a very good experience with PMTI. Booking the class was easy. I got the materials prior to the class even though I signed up for the class only 3 days before it started. The teacher was very good and was there to answer any questions. I took the class and the test all within 5 weeks and passed with an above target score overall. I would highly recommend PMTI.

I would definitely recommend this class if you want to pass the exam.	 "
